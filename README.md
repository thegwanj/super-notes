## Description 
Week 11 challenge where we will use our knowledge of Express routes to create an app that can store and retrieve data from a JSON file. The following is the user story and acceptance criteria for the project:

### User Story

```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
```

## Usage
When launched, the user is met with the home page. From there, they can hit the "Get Started" button to be taken to the notes page. The notes page contains the user's previous notes. They can also create and save a note by filling out the note title and text, then clicking on the save icon that appears in the top right corner. The user can also edit a note by clicking the note on the left side of the page, showing the title and text on the right side. Clicking the plus button on the top right allows the user to create a new note, which they can then save using the same process as before.
